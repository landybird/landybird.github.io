[ngx_http_upstream_module中时间相关变量](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#var_upstream_connect_time)


#### `$request_time`
    
    request processing time in seconds with a milliseconds resolution; 
    time elapsed between the first bytes were read from the client and 
    the log write after the last bytes were sent to the client

nginx服务从发起请求的客户端获取到第一个字节开始，到返回给客户端最后一个字节后，日志写入文件所经过的时间。单位为秒

    
    $request_time 中包含了数据返回时间
    $request_time 中包含了日志打印的时间

#### `$upstream_connect_time`  `(1.9.1+)`

    keeps time spent on establishing a connection with the upstream server (1.9.1);
    the time is kept in seconds with millisecond resolution. In case of SSL, includes time spent on handshake. 
    Times of several connections are separated by commas and colons like addresses in the $upstream_addr variable.

nginx服务，从与上游服务开始建立连接，到连接建立成功，所经过的时间。单位为秒。


#### `$upstream_header_time` `(1.7.10)`
    
    keeps time spent on receiving the response header from the upstream server (1.7.10);
    the time is kept in seconds with millisecond resolution. 
    Times of several responses are separated by commas and colons like addresses in the $upstream_addr variable.


nginx服务，从与上游服务开始建立连接，到接收到响应返回头的第一个字节，所经过的时间。单位为秒。


> `程序真正的运行时间` = `upstream_header_time` - `upstream_connect_time`


#### `$upstream_response_time`

    keeps time spent on receiving the response from the upstream server; 
    the time is kept in seconds with millisecond resolution. 
    Times of several responses are separated by commas and colons like addresses in the $upstream_addr variable.

nginx服务从与上游服务开始建立连接，到接收完响应返回的最后一个字节，所经过的时间。单位为秒。
